        Davey is very good at inspiring bored kids. 
        <br></br><br></br>
        Before he raised $1.2m to connect strangers through shared experiences, coded at Apple, wrote a patent,
        or studied artificial intelligence at Williams, he was a bored kid, too. 

        Davey has the greatest impact on sensitive students who see no point in math, writing, literature, or physics. For them, he reframes these subjects as superpowers... as tools for self-expression.
<br></br><br></br>
If you'd like your kid memorize formulas or learn test tricks, another tutor will be better suited.
<br></br>
<br></br>
Davey's current rate is $290 per hour session. <br></br>All sessions are in-person, at your home or a convenient coffee shop.
